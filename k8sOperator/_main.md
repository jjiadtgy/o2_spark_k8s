# Stateful applications with K8s operator

- The default **Control loop mechanism** is for Stateless application
- For Stateful application is needed **Custom control loop mechanism** because it depends on the technology used
  - ReplicaSet of DBs (Stateful) ðŸ‘‰ A replica failed what to do ?
  - Custom update ðŸ‘‰ if application running deployment changed (= configuration changed) what to do ?

- So we need `operators` to redefine the **loop** mechanism
- **CRD's** is a custom "kind"
  - For example, you can create `Deployment` & `Service` ðŸ‘‰ They are `Resources`
  - For the Spark operator it exists `ScheduledSparkApplication` AND `SparkApplication`

# Where are & Who manage the operators ?

- Operator are managed by the technology used contributors because they know the specifics
- Open source operators on [Operator Hub](https://operatorhub.io/)
